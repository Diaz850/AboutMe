<h1> About Mi </h1>

<body>
    <script src="js/app.js"></script>
    <p> Greetings, my name is Pedro Diaz Jr., and I am a resident of Pensacola, Florida. I proudly served in the United
        States Navy from 2010 to 2014, where I gained valuable skills and experiences. Following my military service, I
        embarked on a career in Law Enforcement; However, recognizing the dangers and risks that came with the title , I
        transitioned into the field of welding.Through dedication and commitment, I honed my welding skills, ultimately mastering the craft. This expertise led me
        to establish a successful residential construction company, which continues to thrive today. As I recently
        weathered an exceptionally scorching summer in Florida, I've come to realize the importance of finding a career
        that allows my body some respite from the relentless heat and humidity.</p>

        <p>I am now actively seeking new professional opportunities that align with my skills and passions, while also
        providing a more temperate work environment.</p>
